# Subexpressions demo

Done for the [Meteor Boulder Meetup on Meteor 1.2](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Boulder/events/224865989/).

The app's structure is left deliberately inconsistent in order to show different styles.

For more information, see the Meteor 1.2 [Upgrade Guide](https://quip.com/RXFlAk9Rc2xI).

## How to Run This

Clone this repo and run meteor with the release flag. You can find a list of releases [here](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/releases), but you can also just use the following:

`meteor --release=1.2-rc.10`

## The Let Down

I never got around to doing the `{{#let}}` helper demo. Sorry... ðŸ˜¸
